                    A cultural festival is a celebration of the traditions of a particular people or place.India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the world, with some of the most deeply religious societies and cultures. Religion plays a central and definitive role in the life of many of its people. Although India is a secular Hindu-majority country, it has a large Muslim population.The economic benefits of festivals are easiest to see and most often citedâ€“festivals attract visitors, which stimulates the growth of tourism and other businesses in a town or region. The social benefits of festivals are less visible, but they are just as important.
